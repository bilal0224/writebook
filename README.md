```bash
git clone https://github.com/bilal0224/writebook.git # or you can unzip the code
cd writebook # skip if terminal opened inside project folder
```

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate # for linux based machine
cd serverApp
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 manage.py runserver
```
